3. `2-print_alphabet.py`: A script that prints the alphabet.
4. `3-print_alphabet.py`: Another script that prints the alphabet.
5. `4-print_hexa.py`: A script that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.
6. `5-print_comb2.py`: A script that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
7. `6-print_comb3.py`: A script that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
8. `7-islower.py`: A function that checks for lowercase character.
9. `8-uppercase.py`: A function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

11. `10-add.py`: A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
12. `11-pow.py`: A function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and return the value.
13. `12-fizzbuzz.py`: A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
14. `13-insert_number.c`, `13-main.c`, `linked_lists.c`, `lists.h`: C files that contain a function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
15. `100-print_tebalpha.py`: A script that prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase.
16. `101-remove_char_at.py`: A function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position `n`.
