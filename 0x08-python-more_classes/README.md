# PYTHON - MORE CLASSES AND OBJECTS

This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Higher Level Programming. The main objective is to understand Object-Oriented Programmng (OOP) concepts in Python such as classes, objects, instance attributes, methods, and properties.

## Some of the Tasks


### Task 0: Empty Class

Write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.

- File: `0-rectangle.py`

### Task 1: Real Definition of a Rectangle

Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by width and height.

- File: `1-rectangle.py`

### Task 2: Area and Perimeter

Add the public instance methods `area` and `perimeter` to the class `Rectangle`.

- File: `2-rectangle.py`

### Task 3: String Representation

Add the `__str__` method to the class `Rectangle` that returns a string representation of the rectangle.

- File: `3-rectangle.py`

### Task 4: Eval is Magic

Add the `__repr__` method to the class `Rectangle` that returns a string representation of the rectangle that can be used with `eval()` to create a new instance.

- File: `4-rectangle.py`

### Task 5: Detect Instance Deletion

Print the message `Bye rectangle...` when an instance of `Rectangle` is deleted.

- File: `5-rectangle.py`

### Task 6: How Many Instances

Add a public class attribute `number_of_instances` to the class `Rectangle` that is incremented during each new instance instantiation and decremented during each instance deletion.

- File: `6-rectangle.py`

## Running the Tests

Each task has a corresponding test file. To run the test, use the following command:

```bash
./<test_file_name>
