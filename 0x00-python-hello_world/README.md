# Python Basics Project

This project contains a collection of Python scripts that perform various tasks. These tasks range from printing text to the standard output, to more complex tasks involving file I/O, string manipulation, and more.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `0-run`: A script that runs a Python file.
- `1-run_inline`: A script that runs Python code inline.
- `2-print.py`: A script that prints a specific string.
- `3-print_number.py`: A script that prints a number.
- `4-print_float.py`: A script that prints a float.
- `5-print_string.py`: A script that prints a string.
- `6-concat.py`: A script that concatenates strings.
- `7-edges.py`: A script that performs string slicing.
- `8-concat_edges.py`: A script that creates a new sentence by slicing a string.
- `9-easter_egg.py`: A script that prints "The Zen of Python", by Tim Peters.
- `10-check_cycle.c`, `10-linked_lists.c`, `10-main.c`: C scripts that check if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.
- `100-write.py`: A script that prints a string to the standard error.
- `101-compile`: A script that compiles a Python script file.
- `102-magic_calculation.py`: A Python function that does exactly the same as a given Python bytecode.
